This is a tiny JQuery script that will inject a JavaScript REPL into 
your DOM. It behaves like the Google Chrome console but this will operate
right into your page. 

Why would you ever need this? Well, if you find yourself hosted in an 
environment that pretends to be a browser but doesn't have a console then
this might come in handy.

It works in IE8 too. In fact, it has been made to work especially with this 
browser in mind. _Isn't 2014 great?_
